### Text editor, we recommend atom
Install atom here
[atom](https://atom.io)
Open atom, then find way to install packages
List of things you need to install :
1. ide-haskell
2. language-haskell
3. autocomplete-haskell (not necessary)
4. themes (if you want to colorize your atom)
P.S I use one dark for UI theme and atom dark for syntax theme

### Playing with all tools

In general you will do something like this

1. Editing haskell file (.hs) in atom
(don't forget put the .hs file in your repo)

2. Load and run the file in ghci/winghci
