#Reimplement Haskell function

##Rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1. **Don't use google to find how a haskell function works**
2. for 1.a and 1.b do not use any other function except : pred, succ, ++, :, | (guard), partern matching
3. for 1.b you can use 1.a function to reimplement 1.b

## Small help

don't forget to add "import Data.List" to your *.hs file, or ghci/winghci (we recommend to put it in *.hs file)

for showing runtime and type system evertime you run something
:set +s
:set +t

Use template.hs in firstAssignment, to help tutors review your code

## 1.a List of function to reimplement

null, take, drop, fst, snd, map, filter, delete, deleteAll, foldl, foldl1, zip, zipWith, nth,
sort, scanl, scanl1, elem, notElem, head, length, reverse, last, tail, init, max, min, concat, intersperse, intercalate, and, or, zip3, sum, product, words, lines, unlines, unwords, takeWhile, dropWhile, concatMap, all, any, insert, zipWith3

-- nth is (!!)

## 1.b List of function to reimplement

you can use your other function from 1.a to solve this :

nub, sort, minimum, maximum, inits, tails, union, intersect, group, splitAt, partition, replicate

If you want to be teacher's pet
reimplement subsequences, permutations
